The texture data stays compressed in\n * graphics memory, increasing memory locality and speeding up texture fetches. These formats can also be used to store\n * more detail in the same amount of memory.\n *\n * For most developers, container file formats are a better abstraction instead of directly handling raw texture\n * data. PixiJS provides native support for the following texture file formats (via {@link PIXI.Loader}):\n *\n * * **.dds** - the DirectDraw Surface file format stores DXTn (DXT-1,3,5) data. See {@link PIXI.DDSLoader}\n * * **.ktx** - the Khronos Texture Container file format supports storing all the supported WebGL compression formats.\n *  See {@link PIXI.KTXLoader}.\n * * **.basis** - the BASIS supercompressed file format stores texture data in an internal format that is transcoded\n *  to the compression format supported on the device at _runtime_. It also supports transcoding into a uncompressed\n *  format as a fallback; you must install the `@pixi/basis-loader`, `@pixi/basis-transcoder` packages separately to\n *  use these files. See {@link PIXI.BasisLoader}.\n *\n * The loaders for the aforementioned formats use `CompressedTextureResource` internally. It is strongly suggested that\n * they be used instead.\n *\n * ## Working directly with CompressedTextureResource\n *\n * Since `CompressedTextureResource` inherits `BlobResource`, you can provide it a URL pointing to a file containing\n * the raw texture data (with no file headers!):\n *\n * ```js\n * // The resource backing the texture data for your textures.\n * // NOTE: You can also provide a ArrayBufferView instead of a URL. This is used when loading data from a container file\n * //   format such as KTX, DDS, or BASIS.\n * const compressedResource = new PIXI.CompressedTextureResource(\"bunny.dxt5\", {\n *   format:

It can be\n *         thought of the net rotation applied to the coordinate axes (separately). For example, if \"skew.x\" is\n *         ⍺ and \"skew.y\" is β, then the line x = 0 will be rotated by ⍺ (y = -x*cot⍺) and the line y = 0 will be\n *         rotated by β (y = x*tanβ). A line y = x*tanϴ (i.e. a line at angle ϴ to the x-axis in local-space) will\n *         be rotated by an angle between ⍺ and β.\n *         </p>\n *         <p>\n *         It can be observed that if skew is applied equally to both axes, then it will be equivalent to applying\n *         a rotation. Indeed, if \"skew.x\" = -ϴ and \"skew.y\" = ϴ, it will produce an equivalent of \"rotation\" = ϴ.\n *         </p>\n *         <p>\n *         Another quite interesting observation is that \"skew.x\", \"skew.y\", rotation are communtative operations. Indeed,\n *         because rotation is essentially a careful combination of the two.\n *         </p>\n *       </td>\n *     </tr>\n *     <tr>\n *       <td>angle</td>\n *       <td>Rotation.

The abstract `calculateBounds` method is responsible for providing it (and it should use the\n * `worldTransform` to calculate in world space).\n *\n * There are a few additional types of bounding boxes:\n *\n * | Bounds                | Description                                                                              |\n * | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n * | World Bounds          | This is synonymous is the regular bounds described above. See `getBounds()`.             |\n * | Local Bounds          | This the axis-aligned bounding box in the parent's local space. See `getLocalBounds()`.  |\n * | Render Bounds         | The bounds, but including extra rendering effects like filter padding.                   |\n * | Projected Bounds      | The bounds of the projected display object onto the screen. Usually equals world bounds. |\n * | Relative Bounds       | The bounds of a display object when projected onto a ancestor's (or parent's) space.     |\n * | Natural Bounds        | The bounds of an object in its own local space (not parent's space, like in local bounds)|\n * | Content Bounds        | The natural bounds when excluding all children of a `Container`.                         |\n *\n * ### calculateBounds\n *\n * [Container]{@link Container} already implements `calculateBounds` in a manner that includes children.\n *\n * But for a non-Container display object, the `calculateBounds` method must be overridden in order for `getBounds` and\n * `getLocalBounds` to work. This method must write the bounds into `this._bounds`.\n *\n * Generally, the following technique works for most simple cases: take the list of points\n * forming the \"hull\" of the object (i.e. outline of the object's shape), and then add them\n * using {@link PIXI.Bounds#addPointMatrix}.\n *\n * ```js\n * calculateBounds(): void\n * {\n *     const points = [...];\n *\n *     for (let i = 0, j = points.length; i < j; i++)\n *     {\n *         this._bounds.addPointMatrix(this.worldTransform, points[i]);\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * You can optimize this for a large number of points by using {@link PIXI.Bounds#addVerticesMatrix} to pass them\n * in one array together.\n *\n * ## Alpha\n *\n * This alpha sets a display object's **relative opacity** w.r.t its parent. For example, if the alpha of a display\n * object is 0.5 and its parent's alpha is 0.5, then it will be rendered with 25% opacity (assuming alpha is not\n * applied on any ancestor further up the chain).\n *\n * The alpha with which the display object will be rendered is called the [worldAlpha]{@link PIXI.DisplayObject#worldAlpha}.\n *\n * ## Renderable vs Visible\n *\n * The `renderable` and `visible` properties can be used to prevent a display object from being rendered to the\n * screen. However, there is a subtle difference between the two. When using `renderable`, the transforms  of the display\n * object (and its children subtree) will continue to be calculated. When using `visible`, the transforms will not\n * be calculated.\n *\n * It is recommended that applications use the `renderable` property for culling. See\n * [@pixi-essentials/cull]{@link https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pixi-essentials/cull} or\n * [pixi-cull]{@link https://www.npmjs.com/package/pixi-cull} for more details.\n *\n * Otherwise, to prevent an object from rendering in the general-purpose sense - `visible` is the property to use. This\n * one is also better in terms of performance.\n *\n * @class\n * @extends PIXI.utils.EventEmitter\n * @memberof PIXI\n */\nexport abstract class DisplayObject extends EventEmitter\n{\n    abstract sortDirty: boolean;\n\n    public parent: DisplayObject;\n    public worldAlpha: number;\n    public transform: Transform;\n    public alpha: number;\n    public visible: boolean;\n    public renderable: boolean;\n    public filterArea: Rectangle;\n    public filters: Filter[];\n    public isSprite: boolean;\n    public isMask: boolean;\n    public _lastSortedIndex: number;\n    public _mask: Container|MaskData;\n    public _bounds: Bounds;\n    public _localBounds: Bounds;\n\n    protected _zIndex: number;\n    protected _enabledFilters: Filter[];\n    protected _boundsID: number;\n    protected _boundsRect: Rectangle;\n    protected _localBoundsRect: Rectangle;\n    protected _destroyed: boolean;\n\n    private tempDisplayObjectParent: TemporaryDisplayObject;\n    public displayObjectUpdateTransform: () => void;\n\n    /**\n     * Mixes all enumerable properties and methods from a source object to DisplayObject.\n     *\n     * @param {object} source - The source of properties and methods to mix in.\n     */\n    static mixin(source: Dict<any>): void\n    {\n        // in ES8/ES2017, this would be really easy:\n        // Object.defineProperties(DisplayObject.prototype, Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(source));\n\n        // get all the enumerable property keys\n        const keys = Object.keys(source);\n\n        // loop through properties\n        for (let i = 0; i < keys.length; ++i)\n        {\n            const propertyName = keys[i];\n\n            // Set the property using the property descriptor - this works for accessors and normal value properties\n            Object.defineProperty(\n                DisplayObject.prototype,\n                propertyName,\n                Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(source, propertyName)\n            );\n        }\n    }\n\n    constructor()\n    {\n        super();\n\n        this.tempDisplayObjectParent = null;\n\n        // TODO: need to create Transform from factory\n        /**\n         * World transform and local transform of this object.\n         * This will become read-only later, please do not assign anything there unless you know what are you doing.\n         *\n         * @member {PIXI.Transform}\n         */\n        this.transform = new Transform();\n\n        /**\n         * The opacity of the object.\n         *\n         * @member {number}\n         */\n        this.alpha = 1;\n\n        /**\n         * The visibility of the object.

It is\n *  the most performant as the scissor test is inexpensive. However, it can only be used when the mask is rectangular.\n * * **Stencil Masking**: Stencil masking discards pixels that don't overlap with the pixels rendered into the stencil\n *  buffer. It is the next fastest option as it does not require rendering into a separate framebuffer. However, it does\n *  cause the mask to be rendered **twice** for each masking operation; hence, minimize the rendering cost of your masks.\n * * **Sprite Mask Filtering**: Sprite mask filtering discards pixels based on the red channel of the sprite-mask's\n *  texture. (Generally, the masking texture is grayscale). Using advanced techniques, you might be able to embed this\n *  type of masking in a custom shader - and hence, bypassing the masking system fully for performance wins.\n *\n * The best type of masking is auto-detected when you `push` one. To use scissor masking, you must pass in a `Graphics`\n * object with just a rectangle drawn.\n *\n * ## Mask Stacks\n *\n * In the scene graph, masks can be applied recursively, i.e. a mask can be applied during a masking operation.
