Conway's game of life

## Tech
- TypeScript
- Preact
- Preact CLI

## Ideas
- 3D blocks
- Pattern selector. eg. spaceships
- board wraps
- pause
- adjustable speed
- add/remove blocks
- random board generator
- adjustable cell size
- focus:
    - zoom in and follow selection
    - need to track connections between generations
- show a trail of older generations
- cycle through color palette each generation
- a route for each pattern
- auto-loop through patterns
